The icons folder should contain the following files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be minimalist icons that represent finding alternatives or savings,
using a blue color scheme that matches the extension theme.

You will need to create these icons using an image editor and place them in this folder.
